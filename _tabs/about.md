Hello! My name is Sharad Khanna (I go by mineo333 on the interwebs, but either one works). I'm currently a freshman at Rochester Institute of Technology in the Computing Security program. 

As you might imagine, my interests in tech mainly encompass cybersecurity topics. Currently, my main interests include Linux kernel explotation, RE, and OS development in general (However, my interests are about as consistent as my taste in music so chances are by the time you are reading this my interest has already changed).

Currently, I'm working on my QogChamp rootkit which is a rootkit which attempts to use novel techniques to exploit the kernel. This includes all kinds of crazy shit like page caches, overwriting the network driver DMA buffers, among other things. 

I hope to use this blog to talk about this rootkit as well as other topics that interest me.

If you want to catch me, by far the best place is discord. My discord is: `write(1,"mineo333",8);#3385`. Otherwise, my email is <sharadkhanna@yahoo.com> or if you're feeling really spicy you can email me at <slk8351@g.rit.edu> (I will probably respond here faster).
