By describing the sync, I hope to describe how changes to files are transferred from the page cache to the disk. This will give critical insight into how Qogchamp works. How to read this article This article goes step by step through the msync and fsync syscalls. I HIGHLY recommend that you follow along on your own as I don’t put much of th... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Linux Kernel Page Cache</title><link href="https://mineo333.dev/posts/3-linux-kernel-page-cache/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Linux Kernel Page Cache" /><published>2021-11-08T15:40:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-04-30T16:50:08+00:00</updated> <id>https://mineo333.dev/posts/3-linux-kernel-page-cache/</id> <content src="https://mineo333.dev/posts/3-linux-kernel-page-cache/" /> <author> <name>mineo333/Sharad Khanna</name> </author> <category term="QogChamp" /> <summary> One of QogChamp’s capabilities is performing “ghost file operations” or file operations that are easy to clean up and have little to no footprint. The page cache is the main structure used to pull this off. What is a Page Cache? As you might know, block devices (Disks/SSDs) are EXTREMELY slow compared to RAM and CPU. Now, this is a big problem, especially for read/write operations, as every t... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Paging in the Linux Kernel</title><link href="https://mineo333.dev/posts/2-paging-in-the-linux-kernel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Paging in the Linux Kernel" /><published>2021-10-29T12:30:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-04-30T16:50:08+00:00</updated> <id>https://mineo333.dev/posts/2-paging-in-the-linux-kernel/</id> <content src="https://mineo333.dev/posts/2-paging-in-the-linux-kernel/" /> <author> <name>mineo333/Sharad Khanna</name> </author> <category term="QogChamp" /> <summary> Before I begin discussing the internals of the QogChamp exploit, I first need to discuss how the Linux kernel handles paging. This article will assume familiarity with paging as a concept. Quick Refresher on Paging Paging is how we establish a mapping that turns linear or virtual addresses into physical addresses. By using paging, we can do a variety of things such as isolate address spaces a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Beginnings</title><link href="https://mineo333.dev/posts/1-beginnings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beginnings" /><published>2021-10-26T16:30:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-04-30T16:50:08+00:00</updated> <id>https://mineo333.dev/posts/1-beginnings/</id> <content src="https://mineo333.dev/posts/1-beginnings/" /> <author> <name>mineo333/Sharad Khanna</name> </author> <category term="QogChamp" /> <summary> In this post, I hope to tell you about how QogChamp started and what the original codebase looked like. This will be a fairly brief post and won’t get too much into the codebase as the functions used in the original codebase are not used anymore in the current implementation of the rootkit. Motivation QogChamp started out in my high school in a class called Computer Systems, in which we compl... </summary> </entry> </feed>
